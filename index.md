## Hello everyone!

My name is Tamara Gupper and I am a PhD researcher in Social and Cultural Anthropology at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. I am a doctoral fellow at the German Academic Scholarship Foundation ([Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}). Between April and June 2023, I was a Visiting PhD Student at the Anthropology Department of the [Danish School of Education](https://dpu.au.dk/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in Copenhagen.

I am currently in the writing phase of my PhD project, for which I conducted research with a team of computer scientists who programmed humanoid robots to play soccer. Find more information on that on my [research page](https://tamaragupper.de/research/). I am also a co-founder of [The Safer Fieldwork Project](https://saferfieldworkproject.de){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a member of the [Code Ethnography Collective](https://codeethnographycollective-ceco.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and a huge fan of generative art.

I am a member of the following expert associations: [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sozial- und Kulturanthropologie (DGKSA)](https://www.dgska.de/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Empirische Kulturwissenschaften (DGEKW)](https://dgekw.de/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Gesellschaft für Informatik (GI)](https://gi.de/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA)](https://www.easaonline.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)](https://easst.net/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
