It has been a bit more than two weeks since I attended the conference [“Imaginations of Autonomy: On Humans, AI-based Weapon Systems and Responsibility at Machine Speed”](https://meaningfulhumancontrol.de/2024/04/11/konferenz-imaginations-of-autonomy-on-humans-ai-based-weapon-systems-and-responsibility-at-machine-speed-universitaet-paderborn-22-24-mai-2024/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at Paderborn University. In my last blog post, I shared some insights inspired by the pre-conference workshop presentations. Today, I want to explore another topic that recurred throughout the two days of the conference: temporality, or the various concepts of time in technology development.

The concept of “machine speed,” which is also featured in the conference’s title, implies a different time concept for machines that contrasts with that of, for example, humans. I see two main aspects to which this can refer. First, how machines outperform humans in calculations and processing power. The idea of machines being faster and more accurate than humans underlies, for example, the so-called “man vs. machine matches.” Second, that the speed of technology development rapidly increases over time, seemingly without human influence, and not necessarily in humanity’s best interest. [Moore’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, for example, is often quoted as an argument for this position. In this line of thought, humans are perceived as too slow and inflexible to adapt to the ever-changing machinic state-of-the-art. 

Another well-known reference to time perception in technology development is Mark Zuckerberg’s famous mantra, “Move fast and break things,” which has become emblematic of Silicon Valley. This phrase encapsulates a mindset where the primary goal of technology development is to outpace competitors, often at the expense of user interests. The logic suggests that any negative consequences can be addressed later. There are, however, other ideals in technology development that contrast this approach, such as [slow technology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00000019){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Particularly in areas like autonomous weapon systems, it is crucial for civil society to monitor current development practices closely. As I discussed in my last blog post, concepts materialize in software. Similarly, concepts of time in technology development can shape political and military decision-makers' sense of urgency about acquiring autonomous weapon systems, potentially accelerating their development.

The [UN's first resolution on autonomous weapon systems](https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=A%2FC.1%2F78%2FL.56&Language=E&DeviceType=Desktop&LangRequested=False){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, dated October 12, 2023, underscores the need for an international approach to address challenges and concerns raised by these technologies. How can we, as civil society, encourage such an international approach in humanity’s best interest? How can we engage in productive debates about autonomous weapon systems and potentially influence their development to proceed slowly and responsibly, or maybe even stop altogether, rather than advance at machine speed?
