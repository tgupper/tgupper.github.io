### Making Robots Play Soccer
#### On the Materialization of Social Processes, Concepts, and Human-Technology Relations in Software

For my PhD project, I conducted ethnographic and autoethnographic research on how software for humanoid robots is written. I joined a team of computer scientists who programmed such robots to play soccer as an ethnographer and an active member who contributed to the teamâ€™s activities, including programming. Through this research, I aimed to find out how the programming processes and the software that is their result are influenced by social aspects, by concepts of robots and artificial intelligence, and by the technological objects the computer scientists interacted with.
