### Making Robots Play Soccer
#### On the Materialization of Concepts in Technologies

In my dissertation, I explore how social, material and conceptual aspects influence software development in the field of robotics. I conducted my research with a team of computer scientists who programmed humanoid robots to play soccer.  My research approach is both ethnographic and autoethnographic, as I joined the team as a member and contributed to their software, particularly in the field of computer vision.
